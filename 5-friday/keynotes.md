# Friday keynotes

# **Informal meetin**g with grant advisers from LURIS (Kelder) 


1. ERC-Synergy 10M€ (european partners, research grant). Gives everything you need, but moderate success rate, but that should not deter us.
2. “Adobe”-approach when backbone is in place: for visiting and communication (staff exchange)
    1. Marie Curie (start exchange, postdocs) 4yrs (3 eu partners)
    2. COST action 4yrs (up to seven partners, not restricted to europe only)
    3. Twinning (more geared to strengthening the local economy)
3. NWO (NL), UK: much smaller, secondary interests

Caroline: 

ERC-Synergy: how many PIs?

A: >1, external PI allowed. 3PIs from Europe, research focused plus 1 Japanese, but it must be well argued why that is needed.

Q: Would the inclusion of engineering disciplines be favourable for our chances?

A: not necessarily. Put the research questions in the leading place, and then mobilize the disciplines to it. No need for “strategic” inclusion of disciplines.

Q: 4PIs, 4 institutions, each have backup money. Can you attach subgroups in different countries? 

A: secondments! If somebody is needed expertise-wise, but is placed in another institution, such a person can be allocated as a secondment. Requires extra paperwork.

The argument should be in terms of research needs.

Q: What about the competitiveness of the cv-s of the PIs? It is important, but there is no need to be super-super competitive. 

Cecile: from her  own experience: Marie Curie International Training Network. Got feedback: not enough centered in Europe. Now got COST. Not much money, quite a lot of admin, but many people energized. 140 k€ per year. [https://euroweb.uw.edu.pl/](https://euroweb.uw.edu.pl/) 

COST is a network of countries, not necessarily European. Countries have to subscribe to COST. ([https://www.cost.eu/about/members/](https://www.cost.eu/about/members/))

Q: Is UK still in ERC? A: It seems so, but not sure if fully formalized. Alas, “UK recipients of ERC had just their offers withdrawn”

Q: Is CH in ERC? A: yes.

Q: Twinning? Could be interesting for NL-CZ groups. ([https://rea.ec.europa.eu/funding-and-grants/horizon-europe-widening-participation-and-spreading-excellence/twinning](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/funding-and-grants/horizon-europe-widening-participation-and-spreading-excellence/twinning_de))

A: No call at the moment (last call was this month). Twinning is about sharing experience in the form of strengthening a particular institution in its ecosystem (not only academic, think of museums, local institutions).

Rients: does NL have bilateral schemes? 

A: not much. Not even with Flanders!

Adobe approach: partners secure funding in their own countries and work together through networking schemes such as COST and Marie Curie. Fairly efficient, but there is the risk that there will be (temporary) gaps.

Rients: private funding. Is that interesting?

Andrew Mellon could be interesting. Dzemila knows of grants (Rijksmuseum, art history).

Wellcome Trust. Must be looked into.

Lucy: early career reseaerchers. What opportunities for them?

A: Hänkel Stiftung. In NL: NWO-Veni. Europe: ERC. Or Marie Curie, only in a country where you have not been the last 4 yrs.

Jana: in 2020 something started: [WEAVE](https://weave-research.net). Fair amount of countries, no NL, also outside Europe. For bi/trilateral projects.

Kaj: data management requirements? 

A: important, you have to commit some resources to it, making agreement with home institutions, not terribly difficult to comply. Open Access is the norm, unless something cannot be published for reasons of copyright, privacy, protection.

# **Briefing from the LDE Centre for Global Heritage** (De Boer) 

Notes

Leiden - Delft - Erasmus (Rotterdam): the 3 South-Holland universities.

Core themes: sustainability, port cities, preservation, heritage

About 10k€/yr

Small scale funding as an opportunity for smaller parts of our consortium

[ARCADIA](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk)

	Approached through Board Members: [https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/our-team#advisoryboard](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/our-team#advisoryboard) 

Digitization of the excavation films as a pilot project for smaller funding?



* The [IISG](https://iisg.amsterdam/en) might have experience in digitizing exactly this kind of material (ask Dirk later)
* There are national initiatives for digitizing (any kind of) data for further research, maybe those can be used for such a project as well, even though they might come with certain strings attached
* Best Practices and network of Institutions (global) on audio and film digitisation connected to [https://nfdi4culture.de](https://nfdi4culture.de) 
    * Member of newly founded [https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en) (National Research Data Infrastructure)
