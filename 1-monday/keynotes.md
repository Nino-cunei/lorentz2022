# Monday keynotes

# **Keynote 1**: Imaging the inside of clay tablets: the state so far (Mynářová and Vavřík)

Notes



* Research on a homogeneous collection from Kültepe (Old Assyrian, 1950-1837BC, about 400 tablets)
* elemental micro X-ray fluorescence analysis: microCT (XWT-... Germany: this is the 
* technical specification of the CT machine) and X-ray fluorescence analysis of cuneiform tablets
* all analyzed tablet envelopes were already cut open
* tomographic survey shows fingerprints on the inside of the envelope
* tomographic survey: Analysis of some tablets reveals a “tree-ring”-like structure, possibly created as a long roll and then cut into smaller pieces?
* tomographic survey: visible cracks  some tablets do not show temper (contained in most of the tablets)
* Image showing the position of the tablet: K%, Fe%, Ca%
* clay the envelopes are made of is not tempered, but the clay tablets are made of is tempered (with for example plant matter)
* envelopes can be cut open digitally on the basis of the scans
* The scans can also be displayed as a plane by using virtual opening/unwrapping algorithms (based on a description of the outer geometry -> **hyperellipsis**)
    * virtual opening/unwrapping of the I700 tablet envelope
    * virtual opening/unwrapping of the I463B
    * virtual opening/unwrapping of seal on I463 envelope  from a digital model to a 3D printed object of the seal reconstruction
* Scaled model of I152 ablet (i.e., 50 times larger)
* Reconstruction of cylinder seals via impressions scanned via laser profilometry
* display as holographic image possible (I463 tablet)

Questions & Discussion

Q: How do you interpret the cluster of the XRF ternary diagrams - were all tablets from the same workshop? or similar workshops? (except outliers)

A: there are differences in material, we think there were different spots from where the material was sourced

Comment: It depends if you are dealing with letters sent from elsewhere or legal texts made locally. It could be interesting to analyze what we can get the XRF data on letters



* Three elements were not enough, more are needed for a more complete analysis of origin etc.
* Number of measurement points was 30, is that necessary? How many points would be enough? E. g. Just 2-3?
* More about the amount of distortion caused by the conversion from 3D to a plane? To researchers and archaeologists isn’t that relevant how much distortion is introduced from 3D to 2D, but only being able to read the text
* Reasons for temper in these tablets? -> unclear, though temper can generally make the tablets sturdier
* Were the tablets baked? <- might there also be a connection to them being tempered or not?
* Does the temperature of tablets being fired influence the way the analysis used here works?
    * Baking sometimes accidental (destruction contexts) or for preservation (modern!)


# **Keynote 2**: Ancient techniques of clay tablet manufacture: where we are now, and where we're going next (Taylor, Spataro)



* “There is still not an internationally agreed best-practice for conserving physical clay tablets.”
* Where did they take the clay from? Once you collect it, you have to clean it before writing on it  you would find small stones and small voids with plants, shells of various dimensions
* difficult to determine relationship between potters and scribes
* Tablets contain stones & mollusks
    * At which point of the tablet-making process do these get in there? (especially the animals)
* Sample size is a problem - just tablets where certain exceptionalities were noticed are investigated (e. g. mollusks included as part of the clay) -> how common are these phenomena?
* Traces of fibers suggest keeping tablets damp
* Recycling the clay: what can we find in those recycling bins?
* Tablets inside of envelopes covered in salt
    * possible to read tablets encrusted with salt via X-ray Imaging
* fingerprints on the inside of envelopes => Sometimes there are overlapping patterns, but these are not fingerprints, these are textile impressions
* _sissiktu_ - practice of signing tablets with the hem of your robe -> textile imprints
* Questions: How were they made? Were they fired? 
    * Minero-petrographic analysis
    * Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDX). SEM = high magnification images, EDX = measures oxides

Questions & Discussion



* Q: Do the folded tablets also have inclusions (like mollusks or stones)?
    * A: No, tablets with these inclusions will not have been made using this folding technique.
* Few tablets from Nineveh were fired at a higher temperature -> probably due to fire during its destruction
* Firing can also affect the analysis of fingerprints, since tablets can shrink
