* Monday keynotes

# **Keynote 1**: 

Notes



* Research on a homogeneous collection from Kültepe (Old Assyrian, about 400 tablets)
* elemental micro X-ray fluorescence analysis
* all analyzed tablet envelopes were already cut open
* tomographic survey shows fingerprints on the inside of the envelope
* Analysis of some tablets reveals a “tree-ring”-like structure, possibly created as a long roll and then cut into smaller pieces?
* clay the envelopes are made of is not tempered, but the clay tablets are made of is tempered (with for example plant matter)
* envelopes can be cut open digitally on the basis of the scans
* The scans can also be displayed as a plane (based on a description of the outer geometry -> **hyperellipsis**)
* Reconstruction of cylinder seals via impressions scanned via laser profilometry
* display as holographic image possible

Questions & Discussion

Q: How do you interpret the cluster of the XRF ternary diagrams - were all tablets from the same workshop? or similar workshops? (except outliers)

A: there are differences in material, we think there were different spots from where the material was sourced

Comment: It dépends if you are dealing with letters sent from elsewhere or legal texts made locally. It could be interesting to analyse what we can get the XRF data on letters



* Three elements were not enough, more are needed for a more complete analysis of origin etc.
* Number of measurement points was 30, is that necessary? How many points would be enough? E. g. Just 2-3?
* More about the amount of distortion caused by the conversion from 3D to a plane?
* Reasons for temper in these tablets? -> unclear, though temper can generally make the tablets sturdier
* Were the tablets baked? <- might there also be a connection to them being tempered or not?
* Does the temperature of tablets being fired influence the way the analysis used here works?
    * Baking sometimes accidental (destruction contexts) or for preservation (modern!)


# **Keynote 2**: Ancient techniques of clay tablet manufacture: where we are now, and where we're going next (Taylor)

Notes



* “There is still not an internationally agreed best-practice for conserving physical clay tablets.”
* difficult to determine relationship between potters and scribes
* Tablets contain stones & mollusks
    * At which point of the tablet-making process do these get in there? (especially the animals)
* Sample size is a problem - just tablets where certain exceptionalities were noticed are investigated (e. g. mollusks included as part of the clay) -> how common are these phenomena?
* Traces of fibers suggest keeping tablets damp
* Tablets inside of envelopes covered in salt
    * possible to read tablets encrusted with salt via X-ray Imaging
* fingerprints on the inside of envelopes
* _sissiktu_ - practice of signing tablets with the hem of your robe -> textile imprints

Questions & Discussion



* Q: Do the folded tablets also have inclusions (like mollusks or stones)?
    * A: No, tablets with these inclusions will not have been made using this folding technique.
* Few tablets from Nineveh were fired at a higher temperature -> probably due to fire during its destruction
* Firing can also affect the analysis of fingerprints, since tablets can shrink
