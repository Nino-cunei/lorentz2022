## Clay envelopes: function, format, history (De Boer)

* Cuneiform writing ca 3300 BCE to 200CE  content: literature, scientific, â€¦
* Text on envelope  functions: 
1. confidentiality (i.e., letters cannot be opened by unknown persons)
2. protection/safekeeping
3. against fraud (same message on the envelope, which ill-intentioned can modify, while text on the tablet cannot be edited)
4. authentication
* These envelopes were extensively used during the UR III, mostly for Administrative Texts
    * why were administrative texts encased?
    * But not in Old Babylonian period!
    * In Old Babylonian period, envelopes were mostly used for economic texts
    * Usage declined after about 1600, but were still used sometimes -> why?
    * micro CT shows that most tablets were put into envelope upside down and back to front.
    * Question: can we come to innovative/cheap/easy ways to preserve?

Jon Taylor: If I remember correctly, there are examples of tablets and envelopes in the same 

orientation too. I couldn't suggest proportions though. My impression is that reverse is normal

Are there tablets attested which have been re-enveloped after use?
