Clay envelopes: function, format, history (De Boer)



* UR III Texts - why were administrative texts encased?
    * But not in OB!
* Usage declined after about 1600, but were still used sometimes -> why?

Jon Taylor: If I remember correctly, there are examples of tablets and envelopes in the same orientation too. I couldn't suggest proportions though. My impression is that reverse is normal

Are there tablets attested which have been re-enveloped after use?
