# Envelopes and soft wrappings of clay tablets (Michel)


* What were clay envelopes used for? To protect/hide the text
* How to make them? How to read through?
* Cecile Michel collaborates with Christian Schroer (physicist) and Stephan Olbrich (computer vision scientist)
* To match envelope and tablet it is possible even when there is no text on envelope
* Depth of clay tablet ~= 5cm  first the tablet is made and then the envelope
* Since drying takes about two full days
    * Textiles would have been used to encase still wet clay that had to be sent out urgently ->  Cecile noticed textile imprints whose patterns looks like overlapping patterns of different orientations (it is easy to confound textile imprints and fingerprints)
*  Connection between rotation of the tablet inside the envelope and way the envelope was supposed to be opened?
* A “portable” CT-scan is needed because objects cannot come out from museums  (240kg, each piece is dismantled and mounted back as a puzzle)
