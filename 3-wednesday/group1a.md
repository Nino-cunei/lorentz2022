Caroline: how interconnected are the archives (text-groups)?

Question by Cale:

A question: have you been able to isolate „transaction“ or „event“ as a category in the Ur III tablets? For example, if a transaction/event appears in copies of the same tablet or the appearance of a single transaction in a summary tablet. This is a particularly rich theme in the Drehem tablet, I think.

Transactions span time, some tablets are about multiple transactions. This is tricky.

We are analyzing commodities over time. There is a chance that this connects the dots of transactions.
