Climate data in cuneiform tablets (Ludlow and McGovern)

Climate and conflict: could it be that e.g. storms were only recorded during conflict?

So, only the c-ooccurrence of anomalous events climatewise and conflict wise led people to record the weather events.

Answer: no definite answer in relation to storms in particular. We have some very initial work on the general impact of changes of political and / or social environment (very early stages, nothing concrete yet). Indications of hydropolitical conflict, but no analysis yet on whether this has impacted on the levels of recording in the diaries. We will continue to work on this and will present on one aspect of this in EGU this year (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-10356.html</span>)

Astronomical diaries (longest research project of the world). There is a stream of tablets produced over 500 yrs, with stability of purpose. This could be a nice dataset to explore the material composition of them.

Answer: it needs linking up expertises. But potentially worthwhile. Much like we have used the ice core data to corroborate our findings, this could be a similar endeavor. 

How can you link eruptions to climate (weather) events?

We see terms like _the disk of the sun looked like that of the moon_, which is an indication of a volcanic dust veil. When we look at this term in conjunction with terms like haze, or cold recorded in the diaries and build up an overall picture. We can then use the independent recently updated chronology of ice-core data to independently corroborate this.
