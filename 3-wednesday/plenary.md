## Q0 Discussion about data security

* Two kinds of securing:
    * Protecting the object
    * Securing the information
* Preserving the metadata
* Accessibility of archives and seeing how they circulated
* Finding the objects out of their contexts

Back to the Ur-III tablets - why were they baked (if they were baked) - for protection? But there are already envelopes for that?

Question: how often were envelopes broken and replaced by new ones?

Question: fired versus unfired tablets. Secret knowledge versus public knowledge.

Ethical aspects of security -> deterrence from forging (or forced to forge!)  etc.

Cryptography as a method for securing data?

Kaj: what were the reasons that cuneiform writing fell out of use?

Is it a protection/security matter?

Cuneiform had an exceptionally long track record, so, in a sense it did really well.

Turning it around (Hendrik): thanks to writing in clay, a lot of information has been preserved.

There were also wax tables. There is a clay tablet with an inventory of wax table texts.

How accessible was clay as a writing material to people?

Cecile: very accessible to all. It depended also on the number of signs in the writing system (mental difficulty of reading/writing).

Copying is one of the main mechanisms for preservation.

Difference between protecting the **information** and protecting **a specific object**
