# Thursday Q1

## What are the challenges and opportunities of (3D) imaging for heritage conservation?

Notes

Dzemila: what is the best approach for having 3D models of statues preserved for the long term.



* There are (inter)national initiatives for securing 3D-data, like for example [4CH](https://www.4ch-project.eu) and [Pure3D](https://pure3d.eu), see also European Open Science Cloud ([EOSC](https://eosc-portal.eu))

Kai: rethink as researchers how you link up your information, to other communities, within your communities, in machine readable ways.

So in order to protect/preserve cuneiform information, be part of that digital world!

Special research-related information has to be linked back to the original object, especially in the digital environment - however, digital information (like 3D-scans) have to be created in a way that enables scholars to investigate the research questions producing new data

Possibility of using 3D-data to conserve an object in the case it has been lost or destroyed for later use by scholars

Hendrik: the 3D model as the digital twin of the physical tablet is valuable, especially for the non-experts. And it has (a lot of) limits.


## Q2: What do we need from this new technology (3D imaging) to save the text cuneiform data? 

Notes


## Q3: What is the quality of the data that we need to get by this technology (the quantity and quality of data level)?
