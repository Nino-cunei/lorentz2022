# Thursday Group 1

## Introduction to the Haft Tappeh project (Prechel)

Notes


## Hands-on session: Live presentation of the cuneiform workbench of the Haft Tappeh project (Homburg)



* Metadata for 3D-Scans -> grants the ability to judge the quality of a 3D-Scan
    * Different quality requirements for different usage scenarios 
* Paleo Codage
    * Machine-readable encoding of cuneiform sign variants

Caroline: what about accessibility (e.g. visual impairments): how can people with disabilities view the materials?

Jonas: can you put confidence levels in annotations? Or conflicting annotations by different researchers?

A: there are codings in atf for uncertainty. But yes.

The challenge is how to define the uncertainty scores.

Jaroslav: how do you disseminate 3D models to interested researchers?

A: go to the university of Heidelberg to download the assets.

But the digital edition as such is a static web page that could be hosted anywhere.

Kai: the full 3D model is too big to view in the browser. You can download it, but there should be derived dataproducts that can readily be shown in a 3d viewer in the browser.

Hubert:

3 layers in terms of digital preservation:

A: the live content, being edited, researched, lives for a couple of years

B: the static website, the digital edition, lives for 10-20 years

C: the copy at the library, lives hopefully 50-100 years

Added bonus of storing at a library: when they develop accessibility features that are generic for their holdings, the cuneiform materials can hop on with those developments.

Kai: there is no such thing as a universal store for all relevant research data. There will always be multiple systems with different lenses on the materials.

So what is needed: the ability to link objects across systems. Thatâ€™s a community task.
