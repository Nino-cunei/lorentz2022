Rope, textile and reed mat traces on Neolithic pottery (Berghuijs)

Basketry is a source of data on techniques and materials that a society has been using.

Three basic techniques:



* Plaiting
* Coiling
* Twining

Ways of preservation



* Actual remains
* Charred
* Phytoliths
* Impressions

Production Sequence (conjecture based on “common sense” and ethnographic studies as G.W. James 1901, from a cultural evolutionary perspective from “savage” to “cultured”)



* Collecting
* Preparing
* Shaping (techniques requiring specific tools)
* Product

Supposed cross-overs from basketry to pottery (back to early 20th century ethnography, based on “evidence” from Native American societies)



* Refuted by evidence from Tell Sabi Abyad, where the earliest pottery artifacts do not show basket imprints and basketry-impressed sherds are attested later and less common

What about imprints of baskets on clay tablets? There are examples, but how widespread was it? (not known at the moment).

Cecile: I have just mentioned all the traces one can find on the inner side of sealings from Kültepe there: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01674035/document](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01674035/document)  there is a nice example of such a basket imprint on page 180. 

Is there real [skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph)? In the sense that marks went from functional to decorative?

Answer. Yes. Not only in texture, also in shape. There is discussion to what extent it was just a consequence of the production process or active appreciation as decoration.

Question about phytolids from the temper of the clay. (Dominique). Reference for phytolith research in ME (and references therein):
